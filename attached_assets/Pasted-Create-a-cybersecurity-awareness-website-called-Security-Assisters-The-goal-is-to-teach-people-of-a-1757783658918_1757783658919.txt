Create a cybersecurity awareness website called Security Assisters. The goal is to teach people of any age group and language how to stay safe on the internet.

🎨 Theme & Design

Clean, modern design with an approachable tone.

Color theme: professional but friendly (blue, white, green highlights).

Responsive layout (works on desktop, mobile, tablet).

Simple navigation with a top menu bar:

Home

Learn

Know More

Get Help

📂 Sections
1. Home

A welcoming introduction to the site.

A simple tagline like “Stay Safe, Stay Smart Online.”

Quick links to key learning topics.

2. Learn

Educational content explained in simple, clear language (easy enough for school students, but still useful for adults). Topics include:

Why internet security is important

What is digital identity

What are digital footprints

Who are hackers

What is phishing

What are viruses/malware

What are mod applications (risks of using modified apps)

Difference between trusted vs untrusted sources

What are OTPs (One Time Passwords) and why they must be kept private

More expandable modules in future (like ransomware, social engineering, online scams, etc.)

Each topic should have:

Simple explanation

Real-world example

Do’s and Don’ts

Interactive/visual element (optional)

3. Know More

Extra resources like videos, articles, infographics, and links to trusted organizations (CERT-In, Cybercrime portal, awareness campaigns).

FAQs section for common security doubts.

4. Get Help

Contact information for different cyber cells and police services in India (and expandable globally).

Emergency helplines and official complaint portals.

Guidance on what to do if you are scammed, hacked, or harassed online.

🌍 Languages

Content must be available in English and Hindi (more languages later).

A language toggle option at the top-right corner.

🛠️ Technical Requirements

Stack suggestion:

Frontend → React (or Next.js) + TailwindCSS for fast and responsive UI.

Backend → Optional; if needed for content management, use Node.js/Express. Otherwise, static content with multilingual support works fine.

Database → Only if storing user queries/help requests (SQLite or MongoDB).

Accessibility: Support larger fonts, screen readers, and easy navigation.

SEO optimized so people searching for security awareness find it easily.

🤝 Tone & Audience

Audience: school kids, parents, college students, working professionals, even elderly people.

Language: simple, friendly, non-technical explanations.

Use infographics, icons, and examples instead of only heavy text.

🎯 Deliverables

A complete website structure with navigation and pages.

Sample content for at least 5 learning topics (English + Hindi).

“Get Help” section populated with official contacts (India as example).

Dark mode/light mode toggle (optional).

A roadmap for future upgrades (gamified quizzes, interactive security test, awareness posters).
